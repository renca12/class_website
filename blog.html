                Boston has such a vibrant coffee scene that it’s hard not to fall in love with the city’s 
                café culture. We have North End's Italian roasters, the numerous Asian-inspired cafes sprinkled
                throughout Cambridge and Boston, the clean simple coffee shops like George Howell, and 
                our favorite chain roasters like Caffe Nero. I often spend my weekends exploring new 
                spots, catching up on work, or just relaxing with a good cup of coffee.

                <h3 class="subsubheading">
                Ogawa Coffee, located in Downtown Boston, is a Japanese-style café known for its precision and artistry. 
                Their matcha latte is my go-to — smooth, earthy, and beautifully whisked to perfection. 
                During spring, they release a seasonal rose matcha latte that is lightly floral and not too sweet, 
                perfect for warmer days.
                </h3>

                <h3 class="subsubheading">
                In Somerville, Diesel Café has a much more local, laid-back energy. The space feels industrial yet cozy, 
                and their Spanish latte is one of the best I’ve ever had. The condensed milk adds a light sweetness 
                that balances perfectly with the espresso.

                            <p>My bae. I don't think there's anything I've tried from this place that I haven't liked.
                                - Cafe Phin 
                                - Matcha Snow 
                                - Coconut Coffee- Ube Matcha Latte (okay, lowkey this was just okay but it's always sold out whenever
                                I go there these days so I'm not affected by it.)
                                - Hojicha Latte 

                                I want to try the Boston Cream Latte + Golden Matcha Latte still.

                            <p>Phinista is just such a classic. It's conveniently located for my purposes, and their drinks always hit. 
                                I really love their Iced Saigonese.

                            <p>This is just such a cute little shop and it's the type of shop I aspire to open when I'm older. The drinks always
                                taste super good and aren't overbearingly sweet. Admittedly, it's a little expensive but I always feel super at peace while here. </p>

                            <h3>Lucy and Jane Matcha</h3>
                            <p>Omg this is so good! This is easily one of the best nonsweetened/lightly-sweetened matchas I've had. Although I usually prefer
                                a less umami flavor, this one hits really nicely. I can taste the oat milk but it doesn't overpower the matcha. The foam added 
                                a nice creaminess to the drink. I would love to come again if it didn't slightly tank my wallet and if it were a little closer.

                            <p>The location itself is really cute -- deceptively large. There's like three separate spaces that I think they rented out and connected. Their vibes overall are very comfy with ikea/MCM combo. They have these gorgerous ice glass walls on one side that i love. I got a guava matcha latte. So good!! The cheese bread is super warm and soft + the guava matcha isn't too sweet even with the syrup. The matcha flavor admittedly isnt' TOO strong, but at the price point I think it's pretty good. </p>
